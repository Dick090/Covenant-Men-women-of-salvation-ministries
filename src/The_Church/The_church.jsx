            <h4>Who builds the church?</h4>
            <p>Jesus declared that building or edifying the church is something He would do personally. He said: “I will build my church” <span className='bible'>(Mt 16:18)</span> , but that does not mean that He will not also use others for the task. One of the most well-known metaphors used to refer to the church is the “body of Christ.” Jesus Christ states that He is the head, and that all believers form His body. The emphasis of the metaphor is on the union of Christ and the church and between the believers themselves—some- thing indispensable to the understanding of how the church functions under the authority of Jesus Christ."</p>

            <h4> every believer has a function in the church</h4>
            <p>According to Paul, every believer has a function in the church, just as the different parts of a body have a specific function. The idea of a group of clergy taking responsibility for all Christian ministry while a mass of laypeople simply receive the benefits is totally foreign to Scripture. Bishops, elders, pastors, deacons, and new believers are simply members of the body of Christ with distinct responsibilities and roles, according to the maturity and gifts of each one. A believer that behaves like Diotrephes in <span className="bible">3 John</span>  (who takes ownership of the local church, believing himself to be the maximum authority) usurps the place of Christ.

            <h4>SALVATION MINISTRIES</h4>
            <p>Spreading the Gospel Worldwide. Salvation Ministries has a mission to spread the gospel globally and establish the Kingdom of God on earth. This has led to the establishment of over 1000 satellite churches and 20,000 home cell centers worldwide. In 2011, the ministry achieved a remarkable feat by starting 14 satellite churches in a single day, each running five services with massive attendance. In 2020, the ministry began running seven services with interpretation in multiple languages, including indigenous and foreign languages. The ministry currently has over 1,000 pastors and missionaries working to fulfill its mission.</p>

            <h4>What is the future of the church?</h4>
            <p>The future of the Lord’s church is a glorious one. The church will not only be victorious in heaven, but here on earth as well. By taking another look at <span className='bible'>Matthew 16:18</span>, we see that it refers to the church when it says “and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.” Jesus’s statement here does not present a small and fearful group of timid believers. On the contrary, it shows a vigorous and bold church, capable of coming out victorious in any circumstance, including death..</p>
            <p>
            The future of the church was established on the mission statement in <span className="bible">Matthew 28:19</span> : “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations . . .” The verse does not invite us to make disciples “in” the nations but “of” the nations. The church must disciple the nations. As it advances, it teaches the nations how to live. The church carries out the work of discipleship just by existing in the world. Of course, this places an enormous weight of responsibility on the shoulders of every believer, as it assumes that their lives are to be an example and inspiration to humanity.

            <h4>What does God say about the present church?</h4>
            <p>TIn Ephesians 3:10, Paul explains what is currently happening with the church, “so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.” We cannot fully understand the greatness of the church. For centuries, God kept hidden this marvelous mystery. That which was revealed to Paul and others is so extraordinary that even the angels watch what is taking place attentively. The love of the Lord for His church leaves everyone speechless. God desired to bring Jews and Gentiles together into one people: the church. This is not easy for those who expect everyone to unite under the Jews in order to come to God. Jesus Christ came to earth and gave up His life to save us..</p>
