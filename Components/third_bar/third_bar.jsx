                A 2008 study done by the University of British Columbia and Harvard Business School, examined if where a person spent their money affected their happiness.

                A total of 630 Americans were interviewed and asked to report their income, their monthly spending including all bills and money spent on themselves, their general happiness, and gifts given to others or charities.

                Regardless of a person’s income, people who spent more money on others or charities reported higher levels of happiness than those who didn’t.

                “In everything that I have showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”

                A study led by Doug Oman of the University of California Berkley found that elderly people who volunteered for two or more organizations were 44% less likely to die over a five-year health period than those who didn’t volunteer.

                Another study found that people who provided social support to others had lower blood pressure than those who didn’t. This suggests that helping others may have a direct physiological benefit as well

                Share with God’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.”

                When we show love, compassion, and generosity towards others what we are really doing is two things: 1) Practicing the same love, compassion, and generosity that God showed us, 2) Demonstrating one of the primary messages of the Gospel which is to serve and help others.

              <span>
              According to the book, The How of Happiness by Sonja Lyubomirsky, when we serve others it not only helps others feel closer to us but also helps us feel closer to others. “Being kind and generous leads you to perceive others more positively and charitably.”

              “All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.”
                <span className='result_th'>The results?</span>
                Since God is the giver of all gifts (Psalm 24:1), we need to realize that our possessions are really not our own and that we are merely caretakers (Matthew 25:21) of God’s provisions.

                WSince we as Christians should be of a similar heart and mind, that is, focused on loving and serving the way Jesus Christ did. It should be no surprise that when we do help others, it helps unite us, helps us grow closer together in fellowship, and promotes more love and compassion towards each other.

              Whenever we give the gift of helping others or are on the receiving end of that gift, we often experience feelings of gratitude.
              <p></p>And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you. <p>
              Ephesians 4:32
